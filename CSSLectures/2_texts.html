                <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language or <span class="bold">HTML</span> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as
                    <span class="italic">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS</span>) and scripting languages such as <span class="italic underline">JavaScript</span>.
                    Web browsers receive <span class="bold pink">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render
                    the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
                    originally included cues for its appearance.<br> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML
                    pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
                    the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics

                <p>
                    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the
                    behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
                    a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                    MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
                    JavaScript.

                <p>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
                    and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control
                    in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
                    by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in
                    the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
                    the pages that share the file and its formatting.
